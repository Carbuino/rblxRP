It uses NodeJS. You'll need that to run it.

# IMPORTANT
Download the **latest** version from https://nodejs.org/en/, it'll say *x.x.x Current*

I've only tested it on macOS. It'll probably still work on Windows though.

The latest version has icons for

 - Jailbreak
 - Phantom Forces
 - RHS 2
 - Work At A Pizza Place
 - Natural Disaster Survival
 - MM2
 - *Feel free to suggest more in my Discord server*
 
If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in my Discord server, or on Twitter.
