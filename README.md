It uses NodeJS. You'll need that to run it.

# IMPORTANT Download the *latest* version from https://nodejs.org/en/, the one you want is on the right, where it says current.

I've only tested it on macOS. It'll probably still work on Windows though.

The latest version has icons for

 - Jailbreak
 - Phantom Forces
 - RHS 2
 - Work At A Pizza Place
 - Natural Disaster Survival
 - MM2
 - *Feel free to suggest more in my Discord server*
 
If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in my Discord server, or on Twitter.
